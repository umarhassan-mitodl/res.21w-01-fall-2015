  "course_description": "_Angles_ is an annual online magazine of exemplary writing by MIT students. All of the works published in _Angles_ since its first edition in 2008 were written by students in the introductory writing courses. These courses, designated as CI-HW (Communications-Intensive Humanities Writing) subjects, bring together students who love to write, students who struggle with writing, students who thrive in seminar-style classes, and students who just want a chance to develop their English skills. These students prosper together and produce some remarkable work. Angles has provided them with a public outlet for that work. It also provides the CI-HW instructors with material that inspires and guides their current students.\n\nIn these classes, students learn to read more critically, to address specific audiences for particular purposes, to construct effective arguments and narratives, and to use and cite source material properly. Students in these courses write a great deal; they prewrite, write, revise, and edit their work for content, clarity, tone, and grammar and receive detailed feedback from instructors and classmates. Assigned readings are related to the thematic focus of each course, and are used as demonstrations of writing techniques. The pieces in _Angles_ may be used as teaching tools and practical examples for other students and self-learners to emulate.\n\nYou can find {{% resource_link \"72d7e937-81c4-41b9-b25a-b22ddeee1d1d\" \"_Angles Online_\" %}}.\n",
